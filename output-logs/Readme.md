This folder contains the output logs of our prototype and of Konclude for the experiments described in the evaluation section of our paper.

Each subfolder (*lubm*, *reactome*, *uniprot*, *uobm*) corresponds to the evaluated ontology partitions. It contains files with the experiment commands and output logs for Konclude reasoner (*-konclude.txt*) and for our prototype impementation that uses RDFox (*-rdfox.txt*). It also contains a file summarizing the time performance of loading and reasoning for each tool (*-summarized.txt*).  

The input files used in the evaluation are available at the following URL: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w3otk3kn2lj04oy/AADbB9CwMCcdgZFou767vDbSa?dl=0.
