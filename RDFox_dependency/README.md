Copy of the RDFox Software
==========================

This directory contains an unmodified copy of the RDFox software packages that have been used in the evaluation.
It contains the Windows, OSX and Linux versions of RDFox reasoner used in our prototype implementation (the latest versions downloaded from https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/RDFox/). 
In our experiments, we used the windows library *RDFox\lib\JRDFox.jar* in the classpath of combined-approach Java project. 


The packages are governed by the original license that allows non-commercial, academic use under the stated restrictions.
