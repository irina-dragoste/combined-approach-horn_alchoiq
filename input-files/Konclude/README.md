This folder contains the input data for the Konclude experiments.
Each folder (lubm, reactome, uniprot, uobm) contains four *OWL-XML* ontologies corresponding to the four ABox partitions we evaluated.
We ran experiments on each, using **Konclude-v0.6.2-544-Windows-x64-VS05-Dynamic-Qt4.8.5** from the command line, as you can see in the provided logs  (**output-logs**).
To save space, we archived each ontology file to .zip format.
