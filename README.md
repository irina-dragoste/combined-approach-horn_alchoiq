This repository contains the evaluation materials for our 2018 KR submission "The Combined Approach to Query Answering in Horn-ALCHOIQ." Namely, we include the following folders:

 - combined-approach: Maven project with the implementation of our prototype
 - output-logs: This folder contains the output logs of our prototype and of Konclude for the experiments described in the evaluation section of our paper.
 - RDFox_dependency: This folder contains the Windows, OSX and Linux versions of RDFox reasoner used in our prototype implementation (the latest versions downloaded from https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/RDFox/). In our experiments, we used the windows library *RDFox\lib\JRDFox.jar* in the classpath of combined-approach Java project.
